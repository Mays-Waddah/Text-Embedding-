# Text-Embedding-

Using transformers and torch
transformers: A library for working with pre-trained transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT). Simplifies model loading and tokenization.
torch: A deep learning library for tensor operations and model computations.
Configuration File
Purpose: Stores settings, like model names, separately from code for flexibility and ease of updates.
Embeddings
Definition: Dense vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. Used for comparing and processing text.
Reading Model Name from a File
Reason: Allows easy model switching by updating the config file rather than modifying code.
File Handling with with open(config_path, 'r') as file:
Function: Opens and reads the file, ensuring it is properly closed after use.
Tokenizer
Role: Converts text into numerical tokens suitable for model input.
Model Loading
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name): Loads the specified pre-trained model. Using model names allows easy changes without altering code.
Test Cases
Valid Input: Ensure correct embedding for standard text.
Empty Text: Test handling of empty inputs.
Different Models: Verify function with various models.
Invalid Model: Check response to incorrect model names.
Long Text: Test performance with lengthy inputs.
