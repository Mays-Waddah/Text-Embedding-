# Text-Embedding

# Project Overview

This project utilizes transformer models to generate text embeddings. Below is a summary of the key components and their roles.

## Libraries

- **`transformers`**: Provides pre-trained transformer models and tokenization tools.
- **`torch`**: Manages tensor computations and model operations.

## Configuration

- **Config File**: Holds model names and settings separate from the code, allowing easy updates and flexibility.

## Embeddings

- **Definition**: Numerical vectors representing text that capture semantic meaning. Used for various NLP tasks.

## Model Loading

- **Why Use Model Names?**: Loading models using names from a config file simplifies model switching without modifying the code.

## File Handling

- **`with open(config_path, 'r') as file:`**: Safely opens and reads files, ensuring they are properly closed.

## Tokenizer

- **Purpose**: Converts text into tokens (numerical format) that the model can process.

## Test cases

Valid Input: Ensure correct embeddings for standard text.
Empty Text: Handle empty strings gracefully.
Different Models: Verify function with various models specified in the config file.
Invalid Model: Test response to incorrect model names.
Long Text: Check performance with lengthy inputs.
